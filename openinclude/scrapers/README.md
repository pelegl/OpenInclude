## Intro


The scraping service will support crawling datasets from different data sources, like github, activestate, etc.

For example:

* https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy
* http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/
* http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578375-proof-of-concept-for-a-more-space-efficient-faster/?in=lang-python

These datasets will be used to feed a search engine, which can be used to find relevant open source modules to the keywords.
