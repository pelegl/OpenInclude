			<h2>Upcoming</h2>
			<p>
			  Open Include is expanding its suite of tools to better utilize the vast number of quality open source libraries. Next in the pipeline is to provide Virtual Machines to be spun up on demand, containing pre-installed open source modules. Minimize time spent configuring locally, and cleansing your personal machine of remnants of libraries that never quite worked out.
